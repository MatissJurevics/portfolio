# Personal Portfolio (not really)
![screenshot](Screenshot.png)

This is quick site that I made to act as a placeholder for my portfolio for the time being. Overall its relativly simple, on load in the stroke of the text will animate in and then the rest will fill in. This mostly just serves the function of redirecting people to the blog (The blog is on a different subdomain). 

**Note: This is no longer being useed for my portfolio.**
